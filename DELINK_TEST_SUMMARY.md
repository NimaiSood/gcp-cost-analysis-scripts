## 📋 **Next Steps & Recommendations**

### **For Production Use:**

1. **Review Generated CSV Files**
   - Examine the detailed analysis of each candidate project
   - Verify that projects are indeed unused/abandoned
   - Cross-reference with project owners if needed

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with a small batch (5-10 projects)
   - Monitor for any issues or unexpected impacts
   - Gradually increase batch size as confidence grows

3. **Safety Measures**
   - Always run in DRY RUN mode first
   - Require explicit confirmation for each project
   - Keep detailed logs of all operations
   - Have a rollback plan to re-enable billing if needed

4. **Governance Improvements**
   - Implement automated labeling policies for new projects
   - Create organization-wide labeling standards
   - Set up monitoring for unlabeled projects
   - Consider preventive measures to avoid future accumulation

### **For Actual Delinking:**

To proceed with actual delinking operations:

1. **Edit the script configuration:**
   ```python
   DRY_RUN = False  # Enable actual operations
   REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION = True  # Keep safety confirmations
   ```

2. **Run with proper permissions:**
   ```bash
   python3 delink_unlabeled_projects.py
   ```

3. **Monitor the operations:**
   - Watch for any errors or unexpected behavior
   - Verify billing is properly disabled for processed projects
   - Keep logs for audit purposes
